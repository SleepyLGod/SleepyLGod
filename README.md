### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I am Haodong Lu, a sophomore at HUST. I usually use the username dong. Sometimes *Dong.*
- 🏆 I used to participate in some contests. [ Won the first prize of the 17th "Challenge Cup" National College Students Extracurricular Academic Science and Technology Works Competition🥇. ](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1180/11133.htm) 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on open-source software. Previously completed some labs including cmu-15-445, mit6.824, and the first three labs in tinykv. In the same time I've participated in **six** innovation projects for college students, including one **national-level** project and one **provincial-level** project.
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: A repo including some beautified QT components that mimic css rendering I forked and revised when I'm university freshman, is [a repo receiving ~ 8 stars](https://github.com/Rapiz1/DungeonRush). Maybe you can try it out.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Databases, Distributed, Blockchain and Cloud storage.
- 📫 How to reach me: 2441164168lhd@gmail.com
